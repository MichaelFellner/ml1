# Color Pattern Memory Level

## Overview
An interactive memory game where players must watch and repeat increasingly complex color sequences. This level demonstrates engagement through gamification while teaching pattern recognition and memory skills.

## Game Mechanics
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Each level adds one more color to the sequence
- **Visual Feedback**: Colors flash and scale when activated
- **Score System**: Points awarded based on level reached
- **Immediate Feedback**: Clear success/failure indicators

## Educational Value
While designed as a fun game, this level teaches:
- Pattern recognition
- Sequential memory
- Focus and attention
- Visual processing

## Technical Features
- Clean, modern UI with gradient backgrounds
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive button states
- Game state management
- Score tracking

## Integration
This level was created to test the enhanced integration script that:
- Properly updates the sections array in navigation-config.js
- Adds entries to MLTeachLevels object
- Creates no-dependency entries in the dependencies.core object
- Updates index.html with script tags

## How to Play
1. Click "Start Game" to begin
2. Watch the color sequence carefully
3. Click the colors in the same order
4. Each successful round increases the sequence length
5. See how many levels you can complete!

## Testing Notes
- All game logic is self-contained
- No external dependencies required
- Works with or without navigation system
- Includes fallbacks for missing functions
