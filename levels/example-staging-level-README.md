# Example Staging Level

## Overview
This is an example level created to demonstrate the automated integration workflow for the MLTEACH project.

## Features
- Simple counter interactive demo
- Clean, modern UI design
- Demonstrates staging to production workflow

## Integration Details
- **Type**: Interactive
- **Difficulty**: Beginner
- **Estimated Time**: 3 minutes
- **Tags**: staging, test, example

## How It Works
This level was created in the `.staging/work/` directory and integrated using the automated `integrate.bat` script, which:
1. Copies the level to the `levels/` directory
2. Updates `levels/index.js` with imports and exports
3. Updates `navigation-config.js` with level metadata
4. Generates a test HTML file
5. Cleans up the staging area

## Testing
After integration, test the level by:
1. Opening `levels/test-example-staging-level.html` in a browser
2. Or running the main app and navigating to this level

## Notes
This is a demonstration level showing how the staging workflow simplifies adding new content to MLTEACH.
