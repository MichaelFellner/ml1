## Critical Reminders for Every Prompt

Always include these in your prompt:
- ‚úÖ "NO SCROLLING - use compact layout (max-height: 80vh)"
- ‚úÖ "Include standard navigation"
- ‚úÖ "Update ALL config files (navigation-config.js, levels/index.js, index.html)"
- ‚úÖ "Brief instructions only (1-2 sentences)"
- ‚úÖ "Use grid/flexbox for side-by-side layout"

## What NOT to Say

Avoid these phrases that might confuse the AI:
- ‚ùå "Create an instructional part" (just say "level" or "tutorial")
- ‚ùå "Make it scrollable" (everything must fit in viewport)
- ‚ùå "Add detailed explanations" (keep it brief)
- ‚ùå "Import from..." (no ES6 modules)
- ‚ùå "Create a separate file for..." (keep it in one file)

## Testing Your New Content

After the AI creates your content, verify:
1. [ ] Level loads without console errors
2. [ ] NO scrollbar appears at 1920x1080
3. [ ] Navigation buttons work (Previous/Next)
4. [ ] Level appears in navigation menu
5. [ ] All config files were updated
6. [ ] Instructions are brief (1-2 sentences)
7. [ ] Layout uses grid/flexbox appropriately

## If Something Is Missing

If the AI forgets something, ask specifically:
- "Add standard navigation to the level"
- "Update navigation-config.js to include this level"
- "Make the layout more compact to avoid scrolling"
- "Add the script tag to index.html"
- "Initialize navigation in the setup method"
