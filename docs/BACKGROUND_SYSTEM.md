# MLTEACH Background System

## Overview
The MLTEACH application now features a sophisticated animated background system with multiple futuristic AI-themed options. The background system includes gentle animations that create an immersive learning environment without being distracting.

## Features

### üé® Multiple Themes
- **Neural Network**: Interconnected particles with a grid overlay, representing neural connections
- **Quantum Field**: Quantum-inspired waves and particle effects
- **Cyber Matrix**: Classic matrix-style falling characters
- **AI Gradient**: Smooth, animated color gradients (default theme)
- **Deep Learning**: Visualized neural network layers with connections
- **Data Stream**: Flowing data visualization effects
- **Classic Orange**: The original MLTEACH gradient theme

### ‚öôÔ∏è Settings Menu
Access the settings menu by clicking the **gear icon** in the bottom-right corner of the screen.

#### Settings Options:
1. **Background Theme**: Choose from 7 different animated themes
2. **Animation Speed**: Adjust the speed of animations (0.0x - 2.0x)
3. **Effects Toggles**:
   - Particles
   - Connections
   - Glow Effects
4. **Performance Settings**: Low, Medium, High quality options

### üéØ Key Features
- Gentle, non-intrusive animations
- Automatic theme persistence (saves your choice)
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Optimized performance with adjustable quality settings
- Smooth transitions between themes

## Implementation

### Files Added
- `components/settings/BackgroundSystem.js` - Core background animation engine
- `components/settings/SettingsMenu.js` - Settings UI component
- `css/settings.css` - Settings menu styles
- `test-background.html` - Test page for the background system

### How It Works
1. **BackgroundSystem.js** creates a canvas element that sits behind the main content
2. Each theme defines its own colors and animation types
3. Animations are rendered at 60fps using requestAnimationFrame
4. The settings menu allows real-time theme switching
5. User preferences are saved to localStorage

## Usage

### Testing
Open `test-background.html` in your browser to see all themes in action and test the settings menu.

### Integration
The background system is automatically integrated into the main application through:
```html
<script src="components/settings/BackgroundSystem.js"></script>
<script src="components/settings/SettingsMenu.js"></script>
```

### Changing Themes Programmatically
```javascript
// Change to a specific theme
window.backgroundSystem.changeTheme('neural-network');

// Get current theme
const currentTheme = window.backgroundSystem.currentTheme;

// Get all available themes
const themes = window.backgroundSystem.themes;
```

## Performance Optimization

The system includes three performance levels:
- **Low**: Reduced particle count, simpler effects
- **Medium**: Balanced performance and visual quality (default)
- **High**: Maximum particles and effects

## Browser Compatibility
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Customization

To add a new theme, edit `BackgroundSystem.js`:
```javascript
this.themes['your-theme'] = {
    name: 'Your Theme Name',
    colors: {
        primary: '#hex',
        secondary: '#hex',
        accent: '#hex',
        glow: '#hex'
    },
    particles: true,  // Enable/disable features
    grid: false,
    description: 'Your theme description'
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Theme not changing
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure localStorage is enabled
- Try clearing browser cache

### Performance issues
- Switch to "Low" performance mode
- Disable some effects in settings
- Use a simpler theme like "Classic Orange"

### Settings menu not appearing
- Check that both JS files are loaded
- Ensure CSS file is linked
- Look for console errors
